This project was created with the purpose of prototyping an interface within a distribution warehouse for the creation of delivery/pickup order to customer-facing entities such as retail stores and restaurants.
This is an incomplete project which introduced in contributors to the use of Git Control, agile development methodologies, and project development and management.
The contributors to this project will continue to make sparse commits to further improve on the work done, but for now, this is an inactive repository.
